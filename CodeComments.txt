Section editor needs a subject combobox prior to course selector

Would like business objects to have friendly references to the other business objects, in the db. 

Glow on section edits.



Note first of all (line 230 in ScheduleGridViewModel) this hardcodes begin and end times. We should be able to modify this. 

This raises right away the issue of what happens if begin/end/start times/blocklengths change. This could raise problems with copying semesters and revisiting old semesters. 
Solution? Store begin/end/start times/blocklengths at the academic year level. (We assume they will never change mid-year). When a new year is created, prompt user for a copy of previous year
or edit a new setup. Work with those for the academic year, and always load the correct batch when opening a year.

When copying a semester from one academic year to a different academic year: check if the setup has changed. If so, scan the semester being copied, and see if any sections 
depart from the new scenario. Flag these to the user, and ask for preference: don't copy those sections at all? Or drop the times on those sections? 









Sorting on sections

Should have a departmental name dialog, fix departmental mention under subject.

Window zoom?

Section editor not sizing horizontally, should size to contents





Increase font size on banners

Fix the settings under settings

Printing

Right click to add/edit sections?

Menu items in toolbar should flow together when window is made smaller (wpf tool...?)

Banner on sections header to show number of sections

Copy semesters. Delete semesters.

Backup! (to csv and alternate db?)

logic for revions of course properties and deletion of course properties
logic for revisions and deletions of block lengths.

Handle non-active courses and non-active instructors.

Workload view

What sort of data structure for alternate workload and other committments? How does thisg get persisted?

Scheduling saturday should be in the database, not preferences to different people see the same thing.


Longer term: webhosting, error logging to website, multiuser. Multiple windows?
