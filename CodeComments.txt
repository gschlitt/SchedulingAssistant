Would like business objects to have friendly references to the other business objects, in the db. 

New section should go after currently selected section, if any, or at bottom of list.

A section code chooser: user selects prefix "AB, CH..." and app sets up ABN where N is the next available section number, user
has option to provide their own.

Sorting on sections

Bug:grid should always begin at 830. Right now if there's a single section iwht some time, it begins at that ime.
